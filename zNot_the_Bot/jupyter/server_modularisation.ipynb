Given the project structure and the code you've provided, here's a revised plan to modularize your Flask application, focusing on organizing your routes, models, and other functionalities into separate modules. This approach will help manage the complexity of your application as it grows.

Proposed Changes
Create a Blueprint for Authentication:
Move the login route to a new file named auth.py.
This will include the login route and any other authentication-related routes.
Create a Blueprint for Bot Control:
Move the routes related to starting, stopping, and checking the status of the bot to a new file named bot_control.py.
This will include routes like /start, /stop, and /bot-status.
Create a Blueprint for Strategies:
Move the routes related to strategies (e.g., saving, deleting, and loading strategies) to a new file named strategies.py.
This will include routes like /api/save-strategy, /api/delete-strategy, and /api/load-strategy.
Create a Blueprint for Betting:
Move the routes related to betting (e.g., placing bets, checking account funds) to a new file named betting.py.
This will include routes like /api/check-connection, /api/account-funds, and any other betting-related routes.
Create a Blueprint for Races:
Move the routes related to races (e.g., fetching races, race details) to a new file named races.py.
This will include routes like /api/races, /api/races-for-date, and /api/race-details.
Create a Blueprint for User Profile:
Move the route related to updating the user profile to a new file named user_profile.py.
This will include the route /api/profile.
Refactor server.py:
Keep the initialization of the Flask app, database, and other global configurations in server.py.
Import and register the blueprints created in the previous steps.
Refactor models.py:
No changes are proposed for models.py as it seems well-organized. However, ensure that all models are correctly defined and that relationships between models are properly set up.
Refactor extensions.py:
No changes are proposed for extensions.py as it seems well-organized. However, ensure that the SQLAlchemy instance is correctly initialized and that it's imported and used correctly across your application.
Steps to Implement the Changes
Create Blueprints:
For each of the proposed blueprints (auth.py, bot_control.py, strategies.py, betting.py, races.py, user_profile.py), create a new file in your project directory.
In each file, import Blueprint from Flask and create a new blueprint instance. For example, in auth.py, you would have:
from flask import Blueprint
auth_bp = Blueprint('auth', __name__)
Move the relevant routes from server.py to each of these files, ensuring to use the blueprint instance (auth_bp, etc.) to define the routes.
Register Blueprints in server.py:
After defining all your blueprints, go back to server.py and import each blueprint.
Register each blueprint with the Flask app instance using app.register_blueprint(blueprint_name).
Test Each Blueprint:
After implementing the changes, test each blueprint individually to ensure that the routes are correctly registered and accessible.
Refactor Global Variables and Functions:
Review the global variables and functions in server.py and consider moving them to appropriate modules if they are closely related to a specific functionality (e.g., bot control, authentication).
Update Imports:
Ensure that all imports across your application are updated to reflect the new structure. This includes updating import statements in server.py and any other file that imports from server.py or other refactored files.
By following these steps, you'll modularize your Flask application, making it easier to manage, scale, and maintain. Each module will have a clear responsibility, and the codebase will be more organized.
